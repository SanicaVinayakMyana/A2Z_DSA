Hashing : is a way to store and find data quickly using key.
        : a technique that uses a function i.e hah function to map data to a fixed position in a table .

For Java,
    - we can create an array of size 10^7(or even bugger like 10^8 if the heap allows).
    - In java arrays are always on heap(created with new keyword).

For Cpp,
    - We can create an array of size 10^6 in the main function i.e locally.
    - We can create an array of size 10^7 when we create it globally otherwise segmentation fault error.

Hashing:

    1. With Arrays
            - Works when keys are integers and in small range.
            - Adv:
                * Very fast(O(1)access)
                * Simple to implement
            - DisAdv:
                * Wastes memory if range id large.
                * Only works with integer indices.

    2. With HashMap(using key value pair)
            - Works when keys are large,sparse or non integer.
            - Adv:
                * Works eith integers, string , char or even objects.
                * Efficient
                * Saves Memory
            - DisAdv:
                * Slightly slower tha arrays (bcoz of hashing and collisions).
                * More memory overhead than arrays.

Collisions:
    1. Division Method - uses Linear Chaining
    2. Folding Method
    3. id square Method
